💡 Project Title:

 Real-Time Messaging system using AI/ML

🧠 1. Objective

To develop an AI-powered system that detects real-world objects using computer vision and allows users to anchor chats, notes, or interactions to specific detected objects in real time with end-to-end encryption.

⚙️ 2. Tech Stack Overview
Frontend (Client)

React.js – For building an interactive and responsive user interface.

Socket.io-Client – Enables real-time two-way communication with the backend server.

WebSocket API – Streams detection data (bounding boxes, labels) from the CV module.

Material-UI (MUI) – For modern, clean, and responsive design components.

JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3 – For logic, structure, and styling.

PWA Support – Converts the web app into a mobile-installable app for demonstrations.

Backend (Server)

Node.js (v22.x) – Fast, scalable backend runtime for handling requests.

Express.js – Simplifies API routing and RESTful endpoints.

Socket.io (Server) – Manages all real-time chat and detection event communication.

CORS & Body-Parser – Middleware for secure cross-origin data exchange.

AES Encryption (Crypto module) – Ensures messages are securely transmitted.

Environment Variables (.env) – Stores API keys and URLs securely.

Computer Vision Module (cv_service)

Python (3.10+) – Core programming language for AI/ML operations.

YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) – Deep learning model for real-time object detection.

OpenCV – Handles image frames and visualization.

Flask (Python API) – Provides REST and WebSocket endpoints for streaming detections.

NumPy / PyTorch – Supports tensor computations and neural network inference.

Real-Time Communication Layer

WebSocket / Socket.io – Streams object detection results between backend and frontend.

JSON Events – Detection data is sent as structured JSON (object name, bounding box, confidence).

Bidirectional Data Flow – Enables both detection → user and user → chat sync in milliseconds.

Database (Optional)

MongoDB / Local JSON Store – Used for storing chat history, user sessions, and object data.

Encryption & Cryptography

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) – Encrypts every chat message before transmission.

ECDH Key Exchange (Public Key Forwarding) – Used for secure session key negotiation between users.

Node Crypto Library – Handles key generation and message decryption.

Deployment

Render – Hosts the Node/Flask backend servers.

Vercel – Hosts the React frontend for web and mobile access.

GitHub – Source code version control and deployment automation.

🧩 3. System Architecture Flow

Camera Input: The live camera feed is processed through the YOLOv8 model.

Object Detection: YOLO detects multiple objects and generates bounding boxes + labels.

Data Streaming: Detection data is sent in JSON format through WebSocket to Node.js.

Backend Relay: Node.js forwards the data via Socket.io to all connected clients.

Frontend Visualization:

React receives object data and displays bounding boxes dynamically.

Users can tap or click on detected objects to start encrypted chats.

Encryption:

Each chat message is AES encrypted before sending.

Decryption occurs locally on the receiver side.

Real-Time Sync:

Detection + chat data update instantly across all connected devices.

💬 4. Key Features

🎯 Real-time object detection using YOLOv8.

💬 Object-anchored chat — chat messages appear above the detected object.

🔒 End-to-end encryption using AES.

⚡️ Instant communication via Socket.io and WebSocket.

🧠 AI-integrated CV system for live detection and tracking.

📱 Mobile-friendly PWA (Progressive Web App) support.

🧩 Modular architecture (React + Node + Python + Socket).

🌐 Multi-device access (can run on browser and mobile).

🌍 5. Applications

🏭 Industrial Monitoring:
Detects machinery or parts and allows technicians to annotate or chat about specific components.

🧰 Remote Maintenance & AR Collaboration:
Engineers can discuss live detected equipment parts during remote troubleshooting.

🏫 Educational Demonstrations:
Students can learn about real-world objects with interactive AI detection and explanations.

🛒 E-Commerce / Retail:
Identify products on screen and instantly chat or get details about that specific item.

🚘 Smart Surveillance:
Detect vehicles, humans, or objects in restricted zones and attach alerts or messages.

🤖 Robotics & IoT:
Integrates with IoT systems to send commands or chat logs to detected smart devices.

🧑‍💼 AI Assistance Tools:
Can power AR-based assistants where the user interacts directly with real-world objects.

🚀 6. Future Scope

Mobile App Conversion (React Native / Flutter):
Convert the web interface into a full Android/iOS app.

Voice Command Integration:
Enable voice-based interaction with detected objects.

3D Object Recognition:
Upgrade YOLOv8 to handle 3D mapping and tracking.

Cloud AI Integration:
Use Google Vision / AWS Rekognition for more accurate detection.

Database Enhancement:
Implement MongoDB Atlas or Firebase for persistent chat storage.

Multi-User Collaboration:
Allow multiple users to view and annotate the same detected scene simultaneously.

Offline Mode for PWA:
Allow partial functionality even without internet connectivity.
